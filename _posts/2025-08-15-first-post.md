- **Object-Oriented:** Helps in designing modular and reusable code.
- **Rich Ecosystem:** Tons of libraries, frameworks, and tools.
- **Community Support:** A massive global community to help you learn and grow.

## Your First Java Program

Let's write a simple Java program to print a greeting.

```bash
public class HelloJava {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, Java World!");
    }
}

```

Explanation:

- public class HelloJava – Defines a class named HelloJava.
- public static void main(String[] args) – The entry point of any Java program.
- System.out.println("Hello, Java World!"); – Prints text to the console.

Run the program using:
```bash
javac HelloJava.java
java HelloJava

```
Output:
```bash
Hello, Java World!
```
