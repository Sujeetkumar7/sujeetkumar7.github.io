Java is constantly evolving. Whether you’re a beginner or an experienced developer, understanding both old and new features is crucial for writing robust, maintainable, and modern Java applications. Here’s a detailed roadmap to guide you.

---

## **1. Core Java Fundamentals**

Even with new versions, the foundation remains the same. Mastering these ensures you can adapt to new features easily.

* **Data Types & Variables** – Primitive types, wrapper classes, and type casting.
* **Operators** – Arithmetic, relational, logical, bitwise, and assignment operators.
* **Control Flow Statements** – `if`, `else`, `switch`, loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`).
* **Methods & Recursion** – Method overloading, recursion, variable arguments.
* **Exception Handling** – Checked vs unchecked exceptions, try-catch-finally, custom exceptions.
* **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** – Classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, encapsulation.
* **Access Modifiers & Packages** – `public`, `private`, `protected`, default, package structure.

---

## **2. Advanced Core Java Concepts**

These are crucial for professional development and interview preparation.

* **Collections Framework** – `List`, `Set`, `Map`, `Queue`, `Deque`, and their implementations.
* **Generics** – Type safety, generic methods, wildcards.
* **Streams & Lambda Expressions** – Functional programming in Java 8+, operations like `filter`, `map`, `reduce`.
* **Functional Interfaces** – `Predicate`, `Function`, `Consumer`, `Supplier`.
* **Java I/O and NIO** – File handling, buffered streams, serialization, Path API.
* **Concurrency** – Threads, Runnable, Callable, ExecutorService, thread safety, `synchronized`, `volatile`.
* **Java Memory Model** – Stack vs Heap, Garbage Collection, JVM internals.

---

## **3. Modern Java Features (Java 8 to 21)**

Focus here to stay relevant in modern enterprise applications.

* **Java 8**

    * Lambda Expressions & Functional Programming
    * Streams API & Parallel Streams
    * Default & Static Methods in Interfaces
    * Optional Class for null handling
    * Date & Time API (`java.time`)

* **Java 9**

    * Module System (`module-info.java`)
    * JShell (Java REPL)
    * Improved `Stream` API (`takeWhile`, `dropWhile`)

* **Java 10-11**

    * Local-Variable Type Inference (`var`)
    * New `String` methods (`isBlank`, `lines`)
    * HTTP Client API

* **Java 14-15**

    * Records (compact data classes)
    * Pattern Matching for `instanceof`
    * Text Blocks (`"""`)

* **Java 17 (LTS)**

    * Sealed Classes
    * Enhanced `switch` expressions
    * Pattern Matching in `switch`
    * Strong encapsulation in JDK

* **Java 19-21 (Latest Features)**

    * Virtual Threads (Project Loom)
    * Structured Concurrency
    * Record Patterns
    * String templates (Preview in Java 21)
    * Scoped Values and Foreign Function & Memory API

---

## **4. Java Design Patterns & Best Practices**

Learning patterns ensures you can design maintainable and reusable code.

* **Creational Patterns** – Singleton, Factory, Builder
* **Structural Patterns** – Adapter, Decorator, Proxy
* **Behavioral Patterns** – Observer, Strategy, Command
* **SOLID Principles** – Maintainable code architecture
* **Clean Code Practices** – Naming conventions, code readability, modularization

---

## **5. Java Ecosystem & Tools**

To be a professional Java developer, you must also know the ecosystem:

* **Build Tools** – Maven, Gradle
* **Unit Testing** – JUnit 5, Mockito, TestNG
* **Logging** – SLF4J, Logback, Log4j2
* **Version Control** – Git & GitHub
* **IDEs** – IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse

---

## **6. Java in Real-world Applications**

Learn how Java is applied in real projects:

* **Spring Framework** – Spring Boot, Spring Data, Spring Security
* **Microservices** – REST APIs, Spring Cloud, Kafka integration
* **Database** – JDBC, JPA/Hibernate, PostgreSQL, MongoDB
* **Cloud & DevOps** – AWS Java SDK, Docker, Kubernetes

---

## **7. Optional: Advanced Java Concepts**

These give you an edge for high-performance and scalable systems:

* **Reactive Programming** – Project Reactor, RxJava
* **Concurrency Utilities** – ForkJoinPool, CompletableFuture
* **JVM Performance Tuning** – Profiling, GC tuning, memory leaks analysis
* **Security** – Encryption, JWT, OAuth2

---

### **Conclusion**

A modern Java developer should combine **solid core Java knowledge** with **latest language features** and **framework expertise**. Start from fundamentals, then explore streams, lambda expressions, modules, and finally embrace Java 17–21 innovations like virtual threads, records, and structured concurrency.
